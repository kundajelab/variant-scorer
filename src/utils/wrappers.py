class ChromBPNetWrapper(torch.nn.Module):
	"""A wrapper class that returns counts and transformed profiles
	from a bias-corrected ChromBPNet model.

	This class takes in a trained model, specifically expecting a BPNet model
	from a trained bias-corrected ChromBPNet model (i.e. `chrombpnet_nobias.h5`),
	_not_ the full accessibility model.

	It returns outputs the same shape as the BPNet model, but with the predicted
	profile logits softmaxed and scaled by the exponent of the predicted counts.
	This is for convenience when plotting, since in e.g. bigwigs, we are inspecting
	the scaled profile, not the unnormalized logits.

	Parameters
	----------
	model: torch.nn.Module
		A torch model to be wrapped.

	"""
	Separates a list of [profile, counts] lists, one for each of the model folds, into two separate lists:
	one for profiles and one for counts, with each element corresponding to a fold, then stacks the outputs.

	Args:
		y (list): A list where each element is a list containing two items:
		[profile (torch.Tensor or similar), counts (torch.Tensor or similar)].

	Returns:
		tuple: A tuple containing two lists:
				(profiles (list), counts (list))
				profiles: A list of the profile elements from the input data.
				counts: A list of the counts elements from the input data.
